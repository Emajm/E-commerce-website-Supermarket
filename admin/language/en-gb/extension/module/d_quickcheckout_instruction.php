			<h3>Statistics, AB analysis, Google Analytics Events</h3>
			<p>As part of the new AQC since version 6.0.0 we have added a statistics feature that allows you to collect valuable information about each order, how many actions did the customer make before he made a successful purchase, as well as the time it took for him. </p>
			<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
				<h4>Note!</h4>
				<p>The rating is a AQC grade of the easiness of the specific order made with this checkout setting. The less the customer had to make actions – the better the rating.</p>
			</div>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="label label-default">Gray count</span>: total amount of fields to fill.</li>
				<li><span class="label label-info">Blue count</span>: total amount of fields edited and updated.</li>
				<li><span class="label label-success">Green count</span>: total amount of buttons pressed.</li>
				<li><span class="label label-danger">Red count</span>: total amount of errors shown.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>With this data you can evaluate the quality of your checkout setting. </p>
			<h3>AB Testing</h3>
			<p>Once we have created the checkout rating, we added the feature of multiple checkout settings. For any webshop you can create an unlimited amount of settings to test different concepts. </p>
			<p>On the homepage you will see all your checkout settings and their probability, with which this setting may be shown to the customer. The larger the number of the probability – the better the chances of this setting to be shown.</p>
			<h4>Basic AB testing for AQC</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Always test 2 checkouts at the same time. </li>
				<li>Start with setting two different color themes for the checkout.</li>
				<li>Run the test for a week and pick the best color theme. </li>
				<li>Then test the amount of fields. Select the maximum amount of fields and the minimum amount of fields. </li>
				<li>Run the test for a week and pick the best amount of fields. </li>
				<li>Then test the default payment and shipping methods. Run the test for a week.</li>
				<li>And finally test the layout of the blocks. </li>
			</ol>
			<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
				<h4>Note!</h4>
				<p>Remember that if a customer has visited your shop and was already on the checkout page, he will continue to see that checkout setting unless you delete it or set the probability to 0.</p>

			<h3>Debug</h3>
			<p>AQC has a powerful debugging option.  </p>
			<p>On the homepage turn on the debug mode and refresh the admin page. You will see a new tab “debug”. Now run your checkout on the shop. All the information will be logged into the debug log.</p>
			<p>For there you can locate which of the steps is causing a drop in speed, creating an error and more. </p>

		<div class="tab-body">
			<h3>Development</h3>
			<p>We strongly encourage future development to follow these rules:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Do not alter the controllers and models of the module</li>
				<li>Create a new tpl file in your current theme. </li>
				<li>Add logic code via vqmod/ocmod</li>
				<li>Where possible, use the basic module development pattern. In many cases you do not need to alter AQC at all. </li>
				<li>Use the custom style option in admin -> AQC -> design to add custom styles. Do not alter the CSS files.</li>
				<li>If you want to create a unique style for the whole checkout, use the built-in theme manager. Simply create a file of your theme like so
			
					<blockquote>
						<p>catalog/view/theme/default/stylesheet/d_quickcheckout/theme/MYTHEME.css</p>
					</blockquote>
				and add the styles there. Then go to the admin and select this theme. </li>
			</ol>
			<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
				<h4>Note!</h4>
				<p>In <code>system/mbooth/xml</code> you will find the <code>mbooth_d_quickcheckout.xml</code> file, which keeps trek of all the files and folders that are part of the module. Also you will more useful information there like the version, dependencies and updates for this module. </p>

			<h3>Q&A</h3>
			<h4>Q: I have installed the checkout, but I don’t see it on my shop. Why?</h4>
			<p>A: There may be several reasons. </p>
			<ol>
				<li>Check that vqmod is installed</li>
				<li>Check that vqmod is working and is creating the required vq2-catalog_controller_checkout_checkout.php</li>
				<li>Check that you have turned on the checkout by sliding the Status to ON</li>
				<li>Check that you have saved the settings and that it is actually saved.</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>Q: I have another language (not English) How to change the titles and descriptions? </h4>
			<p>A: For this we have the title and description fields in each block in the admin panel of the checkout. Simply add your text to each of the languages available.</p>
			<h4>Q: After I have installed the AQC - i have started to receive dropped orders. Why so many? </h4>
			<p>A: Our module is a one-page checkout, and it loads all the fields as well as shipping and payment methods. So of the payment methods require the checkout to have a created order otherwise it will not work. That is why our checkout creates an order in the beginning of the load, and not like the default - after all the data has been entered. We keep trek of created orders and if the customer left the shop right after he loaded the checkout - the order will be created and set to dropped unlike in the default checkout - he would have had to fill in all the data. So in reality our checkout is showing you the real dropped orders and that is why you see them all and can make a better judgment.</p>
			<h4>Q: I have installed the social login module, but I don’t see them on the checkout step. Why?</h4>
			<p>A: There are several reasons:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Check that you have turned on the social login module</li>
				<li>Check that you have saved the settings of the social login module</li>
				<li>Check that you have actually turned on the social login in the AQC login tab.</li>
				<li>When checking, be sure that you are not logged in. If you are – you will not see the social login option by defualt. </li>
			</ol>
			<h4>Q: I am editing the checkout settings, but the checkout is not changing. Why?</h4>
			<p>A: If you have check that you have correctly installed the checkout, be sure to edit the settings you are actually viewing on the webshop. For this go to admin -> AQC -> home tab and click on the eye of the checkout settings you want to view. </p>
			<h4>Q: My AQC is very slow. What is wrong? </h4>
			<p>A: Our checkout is the fastest on the market. But if this happens to you, there may be several reasons:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>You have a slow server – if the whole webshop is slow, do not expect the checkout fly. </li>
				<li>You may have a slow shipping method. If you are using a shipping method which is making CURL requests to another server, the checkout will have to wait every time the shipping method has to make a call. </li>
				<li>Your payment method is taking time. </li>
			</ol>
			<h4>Q: I have a third party module which works fine on the default checkout, but is not working with the AQC. What do I do?</h4>
			<p>A: We support our checkout to work with default payment and shipping methods, as well as the total modules.
			We do not promise that it will work with all of the thousands of methods out there. If you need to solve a compatibility issue, we suggest you contact the developer of the method or module to assist you with this. Our checkout solution is the number on the market. It has over 40 000 downloads. By adding the compatibility for our module the developer of the method will increase his customer base and his sales.
			If the developer refuses, we can offer premium support for an extra fee. Please keep in mind that the solution will be only for your checkout and you will lose the possibility for future update, which is a loss for you. That is why we suggest the developer of the third party module to add support. </p>
