In some cases we advise to use a popup window for a payment that has a lot of input feilds which you do not want to update every time you edit your address fields. Since opencart requires you to update the payment block, you can use this option to make the process more user-friendly by providing a popup window with the payment step as the final step. Also in some cases you can use this option to validate the payment method to work with AQC as a compatibility solution.</p>';
